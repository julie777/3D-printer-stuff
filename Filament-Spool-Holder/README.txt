Filament Top-Mount Spool Holder for Bambu Lab P1P

Why

I had been using a top mount spool holder that worked very well. ??? However, given the position of my printer and the fact that most of the filament I buy comes on spools with solid sides, it was hard to check the amount of filament left.

I really like the dual spool holder on my Prusa, which I modified with an easy way to capture the end of the filament for the spool not being used. In addition, I wanted to try a spool holder with bearings so that there was less friction than the typical plastic on plastic.

I had one more constraint. I wanted to keep the spools of filament from protruding to the back more than the space required for the cord, with its straight out plug. (I designed my poop chute to also fit in that amount of space.)

How

I found a very nice system that seemed to meet my needs (holder1) ???. It has bearings and a universal mounting system so that the part holding the spool can be used on a free standing holder, or on some kind of printer mount. However, it did not have a mount for the P1P.

I also found a spool holder that mounted on the P1P (holder2) ???. The only part I wanted was the part that clamped onto the P1P frame rail.

After creating a mounting arm to fit the P1P I started using the system. I did not like the excessive amount of PTFE tubing that was needed to run it in a way similar to holder 2. I also found out later than my choice of 4mm/2mm tubing commonly sold as Bowden tube is not the best when filament is being pulled and the tube is just a guide. BBL tubing has an internal diameter of 2.5mm to make it have less friction.

After using it for a while I found that sometimes the spools would climb over the small lip at the end of the spindle. I also have some spools that come with only a partial inner cylinder to ride on the spool holder. That led to creating an adapter ring for the inconvenient spools.

Then I redesigned the spindle and spindle holder to keep the spools in place better. I kept the same mounting system that holder1 had so that my spindle holder is compatible with all existing mounts.

I found that bearings are very smooth, but have so little friction that the spool tends to unwind itself. I use the solid half bearing design from holder1 modified for my spindle holder. After running through a few spools I started hearing squeaking. It turned out to be the plastic bearings. I put a very tiny amount of silicone grease on them and all is good.

I moved the filament guide bar from the top to the front as part of an experiment to shorten the filament path. That required switching the tool head cable and adding a cable chain. It works well, but I would still like to find a way to shape the PTFE tube so it has a better path.



Attribution

This filament spool holder could be considered a remix of ??? merged with the clamp part of ??? so that it works on the P1P.
