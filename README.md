## Spool Holder
The spool holder design uses the holder mounting system (circled in red in the image) from
[Spool Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3020026) by HugoHuge, licensed under cc-nc-sa.
In addition the roller and the roller holder are based on the original design, but have been completely redesigned with different dimensions and features.

The mounting arm for the Bambu Lab P1P incorporates the clamp to hold it to the upper frame of the printer from [Bambu Lab P1P Dual Top Spool Holder](https://www.printables.com/model/441742-bambu-lab-p1p-dual-top-spool-holder) by xx, licensed under yy. The rest of the assembly is my design.
